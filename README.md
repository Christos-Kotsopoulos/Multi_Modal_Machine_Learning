# Master's Thesis: Christos Kotsopoulos ##

This repository contains the Python script titled **"Master's_Thesis_Christos_Kotsopoulos"**, which was developed as part of my Master's thesis for the completion of the Master's program in **"Applied Bioinformatics and Data Analysis"** at the **Democritus University of Thrace (DuTH)**.

## Overview ##

The script is written in Python and is provided in `.ipynb` format to facilitate execution in **Google Colab**. Utilizing Google Colab allows bypassing hardware limitations, particularly during the training of the image-based neural network included in the study.

## Features ##

- Implementation of a **genetic neural network** model.
- Development and training of an **image-based neural network** using transfer learning with ResNet50.
- Integration of genetic and image data into a **combined neural network model**.
- The script is structured to train each model over 10 iterations for robust performance evaluation.

## Requirements ##

To run the script, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `keras`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `joblib`

Make sure all dependencies are installed in your environment or Google Colab session.

## Usage ##

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Google Colab**.
2. Upload your dataset and modify the paths in the script if needed.
3. Execute each cell sequentially to run the models and visualize the results.
